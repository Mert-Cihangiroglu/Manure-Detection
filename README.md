# Manure-Detection
Detection of Manure Applications using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data.

## Process

- Download Dusaf Data Set. Contains polygons from Lombardia/Italy. 
- Dusaf dataset cleaning had to be done. There're many areas that we don't need. 
- I filtered the dataset in QGIS by selecting only rice fields. '213 Â¿ risaie' in Dusaf DataSet. Export new features as shape file.
- Upload the shape file to Google Earth Engine.
- Run time series analysis on the given polygons. 
- The index we're testing is EOM, which is the Normalized Difference between Band 12 and Band 4 in Sentinel Data.
